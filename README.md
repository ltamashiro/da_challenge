# **Daltix Data Analyst Challenge**
In this challenge you will explore a subset of data that mirrors (in a simplified manner) some of the data we work with at Daltix.  
The goal of this challenge is to explore the data we provide and share all insights you find relevant in a business-friendly manner.  
This challenge is __hard__! You should aim to complete it within 36h (1,5 day) and send it back to us.  
  
Some tips:
* Imagine you are presenting these to both technical and non-technical members of your company. 
* Take into consideration that the code you produce should be readable and reusable by a colleague in the future.

# How to send us back the challenge

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository to your personal git account
2. Complete the challenge in the `da_challenge.ipynb`
    * Make sure you save the notebook with outputs, as we might not run it locally!
    * No need to send us back the dataset, unless you somehow altered the files; if you choose to do so, make sure to include a note explaining what and why you did it.
3. Make sure your repository is public before sending it back to us :thumbsup:
